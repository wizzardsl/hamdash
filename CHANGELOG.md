# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). The version of record is
`hamdash/__init__.py:__version__`, which is logged at startup.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `__version__` said `0.1.0` while the app was 0.3.3; it is now the single
  source of truth and appears in the first line of `hamdash.log`.

## [0.3.3]

### Fixed
- "Maximum recursion depth exceeded" then a frozen window on Windows.
  pywebview builds its JavaScript proxy by introspecting the `js_api` object,
  and the winforms backend follows public attributes. A pywebview `Window`
  stored on the api led that walk into .NET
  (`Window.native` → `Form.AccessibilityObject.Bounds` → `Rectangle.Empty` →
  …forever). Window handles now live in module-level privates and
  `tests/test_js_api_shape.py` fails if anything data-shaped reappears.
- "Get an app to open this 'about' link" on Windows 11. `window.pywebview` is
  injected asynchronously; checking for it at page load was a race, and losing
  it fell through to Picture-in-Picture inside WebView2, which handed the
  new-window request to the Windows shell. The UI waits for `pywebviewready`
  and refuses to fall back when `/api/shell` reports a native shell.
- Event streams no longer starve the thread pool. Streams are capped at 55s
  with client reconnect, the pool is 64, the bus refuses past 24 concurrent
  streams with a 503, and `channel_timeout` sits just above the stream
  lifetime.
- Card processes are reaped when their last tile is removed; they used to
  accumulate for the life of the session.
- Log records are capped at 2000 chars, and stdout/stderr are UTF-8 with
  `errors="replace"` so a stray byte on a cp1252 Windows console produces a
  message rather than `--- Logging error ---`.

## [0.3.2] and earlier
